**Updated:** *{{ git_revision_date_localized }}*

A relaxed introductory workshop to genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics using the Health Data Science Sandbox. Everything works on an interactive coding setup on `jupyterlab` and partially on a `Virtual machine`, while the code is written in `python`, `R` and `bash`. The workshop is designed to be a hands-on experience, where the participants will be able to run the code themselves and get a feel for the **data and OMICS-specific software and code**. 

Computing power is provided through `uCloud` - look at the top menu for instructions on how to access it.

Every day covers a different OMICS, and you will find **instructions for each tutorial in the top menu of this webpage.**

<!-- OVERVIEW OF COURSE -->
!!! abstract "Overview"
    :book: **Syllabus:** 

    1. Quality control and filtering of raw data  
    2. Performance of various type of statistical analysis which lead to biological interpretation
    3. Understanding the connection between the different OMICS
    4. Acquiring the skills to perform the analysis on your own data
    5. Be able to consider which OMICS data is appropriate for a specific biological question, and which are the limitations and technical properties of the data

!!! warning "Course Requirements"
    Mostly some standard understanding of cell biology, no prior knowledge of coding is required (though a minimum is an advantage)
